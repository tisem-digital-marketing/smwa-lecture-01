# Aspects of Use

1. Why people want to contribute to social media
  * Intrinsic vs. Image Related Utility 
  * [Toubia & Stephan, 2013][stephan-toubia]
2. How attention is allocated over content
  * [Filippas & Horton, 2021][filippas-horton]

# Intrinsic vs Image Related Utility

Why does a user want an audience?

1. **Intrinsic Utility**: inherent satisfaction 
  * Prediction: exogenous increase # of followers $\rightarrow$ more posts
  * Why? Broadcasting to more people
2. **Image-related Utility**: motivated by perceptions of others 
  * Prediction: exogenous increase # # of followers $\rightarrow$ no change / decrease in posting behaviour 
  * Why? Having followers is 'enough', post content to attract new followers

**Research Question:** Can we disentangle these components?

---
# Field Experiment

**Platform**: Twitter

* Approx 2,500 non-commerical accounts via Twitter API

**Step 1**: "Watch" them for 52 days, see if active 

* Active: more tweets, or followed more people
* 1,355 are active

**Step 2**: Gradually add new 100 followers to 100 of the accounts ("the treatment") & watch what happens

* "New followers?": "synthetic" accounts designed to look realistic
* "treatment group": 100 of the 1,355 accounts selected at random

**Step 3**: Analyse the data

---
# Main Findings (Model Free)

**Finding 1**: No main effect on posting activity

* Control Group: 34.19 % of users had greater posting rate after intervention started
* Treatment Group: 40.82% of users had greater posting rate after intervention started
* 6 percentage point difference not statistically significant

**Finding 2**: Differential effect based on # follower started with

```

# Managerial Implications

**Reconciling Findings**

* Two stage process:
    * Few followers -  intrinsic utility dominates
    * More followers - image related utility dominates

**Managerial Implications**

* Brand advocates not always going to be users with large follower count 
  * Image concerns will start to kick in 
  * (How to reconcile with the current focus on influencers?)

* As social media platform matures might see more firm generated content 
  * An alternate way to broadcast to consumers
  * As opposed to a social listening platform for firms

# Lurkers on Social Media

---
# Participation in Social Media

* So far: focus on *contributing* to social media platforms 

* Missing (a **large**) something ...
  * Lurkers

> Lurker: a user of social media site who does not actively participate/contribute.

# The 90-9-1 Rule

[Nielsen Research][nielsen] suggests:

* 90% of users are lurkers (i.e., read or observe, but don't contribute)
* 9% of users contribute from time to time.
* 1% of users participate a lot and account for most contributions

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(

)

```

# Evidence on Lurker Prevalence?


* Is the correct breakdown really 90-9-1?

* One can readily find other estimates out there with a **big** range
  * 98-1.9-0.1
  * 70-20-10
  * 55-25-20

* Though *rarely* are these numbers held up to intense scrutiny

* How much does the exact distribution matter?
  * I'd argue not *as* much as we might think... 
  * ... **but** we must to take into account that **lurking matters**

# The Marketing Value of Lurkers

* First thought one might have: "lurkers are low value users"

* It's more nuanced than that ...
  * Lurkers still engage and may make decisions based on what they see online
  * And these decisions may matter

* Distinction between ([Chen et al, 2019][chen])
  * **passive lurkers**: absorb content and don't spread information
  * **active lurkers (diffusers)**: transmit information to others

[chen]: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11747-018-00624-8#Sec9

# The Marketing Value of Active Lurkers

> **Active Lurkers** transmit information to others

Generate value from:

* Value from diffusion 
    * Share information with others 
    * Others directly engage and also share to another group of people

* Value from own decisions
  * Their purchase, clicks, brand recall, etc

---
# The Marketing Value of Passive Lurkers

> **Passive Lurkers** absorb content but don't spread information

Generate value from:

* Own decisions based on what they see on social media...
    * Example: Positive movie reviews from Twitter $\rightarrow$ go see the movie
    * Example: See an ad on Facebok $\rightarrow$ buy via a different channel

* I've (again) focused on purchase 
    * But brand recall, website clicks, other aspects too

# Solutions to Lurking: Social Media Sites

Why people lurk? Explainations include:

1. Browsing is enough for me
2. Maintains my privacy 
3. Reputation concerns and/or anxiety

How to engage lurkers? Current practice:

* Posts that are not permanent (Instagram Stories, Twitter's Fleets, ...)
    * Lurkers $\rightarrow$ contributors
* Repeated interaction with same content (seeing many retweets of same content)
    * Encourage active lurkers to spread the information
        * Why? lesser "need for uniqueness" in lurkers 


---
# Dealing with Lurking as an Analyst

> If you use **data** on individual behaviour **on social media** as your **only data** set you **cannot measure impacts of lurkers**

Example: Do Instagram ads increase sales?

* If the analyst uses data from the ad campaign...
* They see:
  * Who saw an ad, 
  * Who clicked on it, and
  * Who bought after clicking on the ad
* Can quantitatively assess this funnel for users who **engage** with the ad **on the platform** 

* But they can't measure whether:
  * A lurker viewed the ad and bought due to it via another channel
  * The lurker passed on information from the ad to someone else and that person made a purchase later

*General advice*:acknowledge the limitation, analysis still has value

---
# Dealing with Lurking as an Analyst

> If you relate **social media aggregates** to an **aggregate outcome** variable **lurker effects are "baked" in**to one's analysis

Example: daily volume and sentiment of all tweets about a product on daily sales

How? Aggregation means that:

* **Anyone** who has seen a post on Twitter **might respond** to the content
* Impact on sales could be from
  * Original content creator, active site users,
  * Active lurkers, passive lurkers, 
  * Or *anyone else* who saw it
* But **we can't tell which**
  * This may or may not be what we wanted ...
  * ... it *depends on the question* we want to answer


*Remark*: these kind of studies have other (serious) analytics issues we must worry about

* We'll get to these issues in future weeks
